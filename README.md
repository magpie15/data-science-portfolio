# Data Science Portfolio

Greetings! \
This is my repository containing a diverse series of data science projects I have either chosen to tackle on my own or projects that
I have completed for my studies alongside fellow students. All projects are included in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. While I do 
enjoy writing in Python, I am versed in R as well, and as such you might find all my work done in R on my RPubs page here.

_Note: Data used in the projects accessible here are strictly only for demonstration purposes._

## Instructions for Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc
