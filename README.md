# Data Science Portfolio

Greetings! \
This is my repository containing a diverse series of data science projects I have either chosen to tackle on my own or projects that
I have completed for my studies alongside fellow students. All projects are included in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. While I do 
enjoy writing in Python, I am versed in R as well, and as such you might find all my work done in R on my RPubs page here.

_Note: Data used in the projects accessible here are strictly only for demonstration purposes._

## Instructions for Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc

   - [Clustering of Credit Card Holder Behaviour](https://github.com/magpie15/data-science-portfolio/blob/a3e793d59d3326494b4a8f6b65868b3a5a12ffd3/Credit%20Card%20Clustering%20with%20R.ipynb): I attempt to understand through thorough analysis of the credit card holder dataset, the patterns of behaviour of about 9000 credit card holders. K-Means Clustering is used to better compress and summarize the dataset. After reducing its complexity, the dataset is further analysed for further insights.
