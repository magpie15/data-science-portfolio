# Data Science Portfolio

Greetings! \
This is my repository containing a diverse series of data science projects I have either chosen to tackle on my own or projects that
I have completed for my studies alongside fellow students. All projects are included in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. While I do 
enjoy writing in Python, I am versed in R as well.

_Note: Data used in the projects accessible here are strictly only for demonstration purposes._

## Instructions for Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc


## Contents

- ### Data Analysis
   -__R__
   
   - [Clustering of Credit Card Holder Behaviour](https://github.com/magpie15/data-science-portfolio/blob/a3e793d59d3326494b4a8f6b65868b3a5a12ffd3/Credit%20Card%20Clustering%20with%20R.ipynb): I attempt to understand through thorough analysis of the credit card holder dataset, the patterns of behaviour of about 9000 credit card holders. K-Means Clustering is used to better compress and summarize the dataset. After reducing its complexity, the dataset is further analysed for further insights. 
   - [Segmenting Customers with K Means Clustering](https://github.com/magpie15/data-science-portfolio/blob/bc90623319804095857def856e67bf3551100435/Customer%20Classification%20using%20R%20.ipynb): I attempt to better understand a dataset of 2000 customers using K means Clustering. This is my first attempt at clustering using R and I was satisfied with the result.


- ### Natural Language Processing
   -__Python__
   
   - [Predicting Disaster Tweets using a Pretrained Transformer](https://github.com/magpie15/data-science-portfolio/blob/af2192f778ec3a52a9e3ceb2132c6840df99c8cb/NLP%20with%20Disaster%20Tweets%20using%20DistilBERT.ipynb) : I attempt to tackle the classic NLP Competition hosted on Kaggle. My strategy to predict if a tweet is referring to a real Disaster or not is to utilise a pre-trained BERT Model. I have chosen to use the DistilBERT Model as it has enough capability to take on the task. A very exciting project as it is one of my first attempts to use a pretrained transformer model which without much surprise produced respectable results.
   
- ### Machine Learning
   -__Python__
   
   -[Labeling Grocery Store Items with CNN](https://github.com/magpie15/data-science-portfolio/blob/9b4b7843b7901ba903eab4fa4f29353f0e4543cb/Classifying_Grocery_Store_Items.ipynb) : I attempt to classify Grocery Store Items correctly using a Convolutional Neural Network. The design and implementation of the CNN plays a key role here and furthermore, analysing the competency of the model was also very important.
